    "- In Python, a *socket* is much like a file, except that a single socket provides a two-way connection  between two programs. We can both read from and write to the same socket. If you write something to a socket, it is sent to the application at the other end of the socket. If you read from the socket, you are given the data which the other application has sent.\n",
