# Preface {.unnumbered}

**The why, what and how questions.** I wanted to learn Python. As with many things I do, I first asked myself the following questions:

- Why learn Python?
- What should I learn?
- How should I learn it?

Among these three, I think the easiest question to answer was the third one. My answer: by reading the books [*Python for Everybody*](https://www.py4e.com/book) and [*Think Python*](https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkPython/). While reading, I took notes and completed some exercises.

As for the *why* question, I had a vague answer: Python is a general-purpose language, and it's useful.

For the *what* question, my answer was that I want to use python in the **numerical computing**, **text mining** and other areas.


This book has three parts:

1. Basics
1. Examples in 
    - numerical computing 
    - text mining
